# Notes

I find myself reading countless blogs and articles about programming, but have never consolidated those notes into a centralized location for reference. Doing it via a GitHub repository gives the added benefits of:

1. **Version Control**. I can see a history of my own learning.
2. **Open Source**. You can contribute if you feel so inclined. Find something that seems incorrect? [File an issue](https://github.com/hinzed1127/notes/issues). Want to add something completely new? [Open a pull request](https://github.com/hinzed1127/notes/pulls)

I'm organizing these by general topics right now, although that's subject to change as I figure out how to utilize this space better.
